# Contributing to OpenMaple #
We're an open community here. After all, the whole project is 
[public domain][pdl]. As such, our goal is to make it as easy as possible to 
contribute to this emulator. As a result, we aim to be fairly lenient on 
contributing. However, there are still some requirements. First and foremost, 
all contributors must declare their work on this project to be public domain 
using our [Contributor Licensing Agreement][cla]. Once that's done, 
contributions may be accepted. Secondly, we reserve the right to reject merging 
your changes upstream if they're deemed to not fall in line with what we're 
looking for. It's unfortunate, but sometimes it has to be done. Thankfully, 
even if we don't like your changes, you can continue to work on it to your 
heart's desire. Thirdly and finally, we don't accept merges that assert style 
changes onto the project. We simply don't need a back-and-forth of style 
changes between contributors. So, please don't include anything of that sort, 
and try to write your contributions in a style similar to that of existing 
code.
