<p>OpenMaple is a fast <a href="http://www.nexon.net/landing/maplestory/" title="MapleStory">MapleStory</a> emulator aiming to bring openness back to 
a community near wrecked by solely proprietary innovations. We're not going to 
do it with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" title="Affero GPL">overbearing licenses</a> like previous emulators. We're building 
a new emulator from scratch leveraging modern technologies to bring 
<a href="http://www.nexon.net/landing/maplestory/" title="MapleStory">MapleStory</a> emulation into the modern age. We're employing modern design 
decisions to increase maintainability, scalability, and customizability. Best 
of all, we're letting OpenMaple go free in every sense of the word. It's free 
from cost, free from restriction, and free from worry. OpenMaple just is.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-technologies" class="anchor" href="#the-technologies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Technologies</h3>

<p>OpenMaple, like many existing <a href="http://www.nexon.net/landing/maplestory/" title="MapleStory">MapleStory</a> emulators, is in Java, but now 
all of the code is being written using idioms introduced with <a href="http://cl.ly/QRsf" title="Java 7">Java 7</a> 
and will be updated where appropriate to utilize newer features as they arise. 
OpenMaple is built using <a href="https://maven.apache.org/" title="Apache Maven">Apache's Maven</a> build system. It's fast, sleek, 
easy to use, and it handles all our dependencies elegantly. As for those 
dependencies, we're using <a href="http://netty.io/" title="Netty">Netty</a> and <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" title="Hibernate">Hibernate</a> to ensure that 
the emulator is fast, efficient, and load-bearing. Additionally, we use 
Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/" title="Google Guava">Guava</a> library to provide a set of common libraries to use 
throughout the emulator where needed. To manage and access game data, this 
emulator uses the <a href="http://nxformat.github.io/" title="NX Format">NX Format</a> through <a href="http://aaronweiss74.github.io/pkgnx/" title="pkgnx">pkgnx</a> to provide a simple 
and fast data solution. We want our emulator to be able to get the most that it 
can out of the hardware, and we're sure that users want that too. We also use 
<a href="http://slf4j.org/" title="SLF4J">SLF4J</a> to support our logging to provide a flexible, easy-to-use 
logging system. OpenMaple aims to give choice back to the end-user.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-design" class="anchor" href="#the-design"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Design</h3>

<p>Unlike existing emulators, OpenMaple follows modern design idioms that have 
been tried and tested in production Java software. The entire system is based 
around an event model using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/" title="Google Guava">Guava's</a> EventBus and custom packet 
serializers and deserializers. This makes it easier for the emulator to be 
ported to different versions of <a href="http://www.nexon.net/landing/maplestory/" title="MapleStory">MapleStory</a> with minimal effort while 
maintaining the same basic framework. We use <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" title="Hibernate">Hibernate</a> with plain-old 
Java objects to make working with a database simpler and more flexible. 
Currently, OpenMaple is being built for the official v.40 beta version. Once 
that's more feature complete, we'll move on to emulating newer versions.</p>

<h3>
<a name="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h3>

<p>If you're as excited about this as we are, we totally understand that you want 
to get involved and we want you to get involved. Make sure to keep reading for
the guidelines or check CONTRIBUTING.md locally. You'll need to follow the 
instructions therein to get your code upstream. Once you're ready to go, just 
fork and start hacking away. If you need help on figuring out what needs to be
done or even how to do it, you'll be able to find aaronweiss74 and Fraysa on 
<code>#vana</code> on the <a href="http://www.fyrechat.net/" title="Fyrechat IRC">FyreChat IRC Network</a>. We appreciate your support and 
look forward to your contributions!</p>

<p>We're an open community here. After all, the whole project is 
<a href="http://unlicense.org/" title="Unlicense">public domain</a>. As such, our goal is to make it as easy as possible to 
contribute to this emulator. As a result, we aim to be fairly lenient on 
contributing. However, there are still some requirements. </p>

<p>First and foremost, all contributors must declare their work on this project to 
be public domain using our <a href="http://www.clahub.com/agreements/aaronweiss74/OpenMaple" title="CLA">Contributor Licensing Agreement</a>. Once that's 
done, contributions may be accepted. However, before that, it simply won't be 
possible. We hate the formality of it all, but it is unfortunately required by 
copyright laws to protect against ownership claims. Ultimately, in taking the 
short time required to do this, you're helping to ensure the true freedom of 
this software by officially dedicating your work to the public domain.</p>

<p>Secondly, we reserve the right to reject merging your changes upstream if 
they're deemed to not fall in line with what we're looking for. We'll try to be 
reasonable with contributions, but sometimes things just don't work out. It's 
unfortunate, but sometimes contributions might just not belong. Thankfully, 
even if we don't like your changes, you can continue to work on it to your 
heart's content. You can continue to maintain your fork against the official 
OpenMaple branch or you can shoot off by yourself. It's public domain, so you 
have complete freedom.</p>

<p>Thirdly and finally, we don't accept merges that assert style changes onto the 
project. We simply don't need a back-and-forth of style changes between 
contributors. So, please don't include anything of that sort, and try to write 
your contributions in a style similar to that of existing code. If you fail to 
match our style sufficiently, we'll comment on your pull request explaining 
what needs to be changed. If the changes are minor or the patch is critical, 
we'll often merge it and simply refactor it ourselves. There are no strict 
style guidelines here. Please just use good judgement when it comes to 
determining what fits with existing code.</p>
