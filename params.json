We're not going to \r\ndo it with [overbearing licenses][agpl] like previous emulators. We're building \r\na new emulator from scratch leveraging modern technologies to bring \r\n[MapleStory][ms] emulation into the modern age. We're employing modern design \r\ndecisions to increase maintainability, scalability, and customizability. Best \r\nof all, we're letting OpenMaple go free in every sense of the word. It's free \r\nfrom cost, free from restriction, and free from worry. OpenMaple just is.\r\n\r\n### The Technologies ###\r\n\r\nOpenMaple, like many existing [MapleStory][ms] emulators, is in Java, but now \r\nall of the code is being written using idioms introduced with [Java 7][java7] \r\nand will be updated where appropriate to utilize newer features as they arise. \r\nOpenMaple is built using [Apache's Maven][mvn] build system. It's fast, sleek, \r\neasy to use, and it handles all our dependencies elegantly. As for those \r\ndependencies, we're using [Netty][netty] and [Hibernate][hib] to ensure that \r\nthe emulator is fast, efficient, and load-bearing. Additionally, we use \r\nGoogle's [Guava][guava] library to provide a set of common libraries to use \r\nthroughout the emulator where needed. To manage and access game data, this \r\nemulator uses the [NX Format][nx] through [pkgnx][pkgnx] to provide a simple \r\nand fast data solution. We want our emulator to be able to get the most that it \r\ncan out of the hardware, and we're sure that users want that too. We also use \r\n[SLF4J][slf4j] to support our logging to provide a flexible, easy-to-use \r\nlogging system. OpenMaple aims to give choice back to the end-user.\r\n\r\n### The Design ###\r\n\r\nUnlike existing emulators, OpenMaple follows modern design idioms that have \r\nbeen tried and tested in production Java software. The entire system is based \r\naround an event model using [Guava's][guava] EventBus and custom packet \r\nserializers and deserializers. This makes it easier for the emulator to be \r\nported to different versions of [MapleStory][ms] with minimal effort while \r\nmaintaining the same basic framework. We use [Hibernate][hib] with plain-old \r\nJava objects to make working with a database simpler and more flexible. \r\nCurrently, OpenMaple is being built for the official v.40 beta version. Once \r\nthat's more feature complete, we'll move on to emulating newer versions.\r\n\r\n### Contributing ###\r\n\r\nIf you're as excited about this as we are, we totally understand that you want \r\nto get involved and we want you to get involved. Make sure to keep reading for\r\nthe guidelines or check CONTRIBUTING.md locally. You'll need to follow the \r\ninstructions therein to get your code upstream. Once you're ready to go, just \r\nfork and start hacking away. If you need help on figuring out what needs to be\r\ndone or even how to do it, you'll be able to find aaronweiss74 and Fraysa on \r\n`#vana` on the [FyreChat IRC Network][fyrechat]. We appreciate your support and \r\nlook forward to your contributions!\r\n\r\nWe're an open community here. After all, the whole project is \r\n[public domain][pdl]. As such, our goal is to make it as easy as possible to \r\ncontribute to this emulator. As a result, we aim to be fairly lenient on \r\ncontributing. However, there are still some requirements. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, all contributors must declare their work on this project to \r\nbe public domain using our [Contributor Licensing Agreement][cla]. Once that's \r\ndone, contributions may be accepted. However, before that, it simply won't be \r\npossible. We hate the formality of it all, but it is unfortunately required by \r\ncopyright laws to protect against ownership claims. Ultimately, in taking the \r\nshort time required to do this, you're helping to ensure the true freedom of \r\nthis software by officially dedicating your work to the public domain.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we reserve the right to reject merging your changes upstream if \r\nthey're deemed to not fall in line with what we're looking for. We'll try to be \r\nreasonable with contributions, but sometimes things just don't work out. It's \r\nunfortunate, but sometimes contributions might just not belong. Thankfully, \r\neven if we don't like your changes, you can continue to work on it to your \r\nheart's content. You can continue to maintain your fork against the official \r\nOpenMaple branch or you can shoot off by yourself. It's public domain, so you \r\nhave complete freedom.\r\n\r\nThirdly and finally, we don't accept merges that assert style changes onto the \r\nproject. We simply don't need a back-and-forth of style changes between \r\ncontributors. So, please don't include anything of that sort, and try to write \r\nyour contributions in a style similar to that of existing code. If you fail to \r\nmatch our style sufficiently, we'll comment on your pull request explaining \r\nwhat needs to be changed. If the changes are minor or the patch is critical, \r\nwe'll often merge it and simply refactor it ourselves. There are no strict \r\nstyle guidelines here. Please just use good judgement when it comes to \r\ndetermining what fits with existing code.\r\n\r\n[ms]:       <http://www.nexon.net/landing/maplestory/>              \"MapleStory\"\r\n[agpl]:     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>            \"Affero GPL\"\r\n[java7]:    <http://cl.ly/QRsf>                                     \"Java 7\"\r\n[mvn]:      <https://maven.apache.org/>                             \"Apache Maven\"\r\n[netty]:    <http://netty.io/>                                      \"Netty\"\r\n[hib]:      <http://www.hibernate.org/>                             \"Hibernate\"\r\n[guava]:    <https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/>            \"Google Guava\"\r\n[nx]:       <http://nxformat.github.io/>                            \"NX Format\"\r\n[pkgnx]:    <http://aaronweiss74.github.io/pkgnx/>                  \"pkgnx\"\r\n[slf4j]:    <http://slf4j.org/>                                     \"SLF4J\"\r\n[contrib]:  <http://cl.ly/QRXw>                                     \"CONTRIBUTING.md\"\r\n[fyrechat]: <http://www.fyrechat.net/>                              \"Fyrechat IRC\"\r\n[pdl]: <http://unlicense.org/>                                      \"Unlicense\"\r\n[cla]: <http://www.clahub.com/agreements/aaronweiss74/OpenMaple>    \"CLA\"","google":"UA-41231572-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
